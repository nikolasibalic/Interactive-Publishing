## Motivation and goals

The practical motivation for use of interactivity in teaching, science communication
and policy discussions is presented at

- [*Do interactive figures help physicists to communicate their science?*](https://physicsworld.com/a/do-interactive-figures-help-physicists-to-communicate-their-science/), Nikola Šibalić, *Physics World* blog (2019) 
- [*Learning through interacting*](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2058-7058/32/5/22/meta), Nikola Šibalić, *Phys. World* **32** (5) 21 (2019)
