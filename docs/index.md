# Interactive publishing
  
Overview web page for [Interactive-Publishing GitHub repository](https://github.com/nikolasibalic/Interactive-publishing)
containing templates and tools for creating [interactive figures](#interactive-figure) and
[interactive text](#interactive-text) for publishing in EPUB3/HTML5.

This simple page incorporates interactive figure and
interactive text. For source and tools for creating your own interactive
resources for publishing in HTML and EPUB3, please see
[repository](https://github.com/nikolasibalic/Interactive-publishing).
Created interactive elements can be incorporated in eBooks, blogs, web pages...
or just uploaded online and shared with links.

## Getting started

```
pip install interactive-publishing
```

**Optional dependancy** is LaTeX, that should be installed on the system and
available on command line interface for annotations.

## Examples

### Interactive text
Standalone interactive text can be seen
<a href="interactive_text.html">here</a> or as a part of the page bellow.
Purple elements can be changed by dragging or clicking, updating 
calculated values given in green.

<iframe src="../interactive_text.html" width="100%" height="200"></iframe>

### Interactive figure

  
Standalone interactive figure can be seen [here](interactive_figure.html)
 or as a part of the page bellow.

<iframe src="../interactive_figure.html" width="100%" height="780"></iframe>

Try creating your own interactive texts and figures for science teaching
and public communication. You can start by using templates from
<a href="https://github.com/nikolasibalic/Interactive-publishing">

## Domain packages

We provide some extensions useful for specific domains, in particular
quantum physics and atomic, molecular and optical (AMO) physics for visualising
quantum states and quantum dynamics. For more details [see here](../ifigures_api/#quantum-state-visualisations).
